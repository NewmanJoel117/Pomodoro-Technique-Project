# Pomodoro Technique Project

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that helps individuals improve productivity by breaking work into intervals with short breaks. This Python application implements the Pomodoro Technique, allowing users to manage their time effectively.

## Introduction

The Pomodoro Technique is based on the concept of breaking work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. After a set number of work intervals, a longer break is taken to rejuvenate. This technique helps users maintain focus and avoid burnout.

## Features

- Timer mechanism to track work intervals and breaks
- Customizable work, short break, and long break durations
- Visual indication of work and break periods
- Checkmarks to track completed work intervals
- Start and reset buttons to control the timer
- User-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter

## Implementation

The application is written in Python and utilizes the Tkinter library for building the graphical user interface (GUI). It includes functions for starting and resetting the timer, as well as a countdown mechanism to track time intervals. The timer can be customized with different durations for work, short breaks, and long breaks.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script to launch the Pomodoro Technique application.
2. The timer will display the work duration by default (10 minutes in this implementation).
3. Click the "Start" button to begin the work interval countdown.
4. After the work interval, the timer will automatically switch to a short break.
5. Repeat the process until the desired number of work intervals is completed.
6. The timer will display a longer break after every 4 work intervals.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually included with Python installation)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Ensure that Python and Tkinter are installed on your system.
3. Run the script to start using the Pomodoro Technique application.
